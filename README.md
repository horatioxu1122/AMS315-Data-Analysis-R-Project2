# AMS315-Data-Analysis-Project2
This repository contains work for AMS 315 Data Analysis Project 2. 
The assignment is to provide a linear regression model for the given data set. Each file contains one DV and twenty-four IV. The values of the DVs are in the columns with names of E1 to E4 adn G1 to G20. 
The proect expands the concept that reports on the finding of a generic-environment interaction.
The task for this problem is to use R to find the correlations between IVs and DVs. Box-Cox transformation is necessary. After transformations, stepwise regression methods is used to select the important independent variables. Multiple testing issues are considered. 
This reppsitory does not contain the report which is required for this project.
